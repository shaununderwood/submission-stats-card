#Football Assignment

##Get Running
Navigate to the project's folder and type the following:

	npm run build 

When the browser opens you may need to refresh the page.

##Prerequisits
You will need node installed, preferably v6.5.x

##Tested
i've tested this on chrome, firefox, android default web browser, android chrome, android firefox, safari, all working fine.

##Introduction

This README.md file accompanies a small project.

The task at hand as not stated, but included a StatCard image, psd, data in a json file, and images of football clubs and a small selection of players.

My instructions were, to do something with it, and use vanilla JS.

Judging from the psd this was to be a phone based program so I built it with that in mind - when you visit the webpage you must adjust your screen for the pages to render as expected.

##Critique
1. I used jqLite which is smaller, more performant and less featured that jQuery - so I don't have to rewrite simple selector routines everywhere.
2. I used a single function from Pegasus to handle json file collection
3. I used SASS for styling
4. No minification was performed
6. The Select control has not be substituted for a nice one
7. I didn;'t use any css frameworks, and i'm not too sharp on that front
8. Code I think is well structured. Clearly labelled, perhaps a little verbose
9. No unit tests, no caching, no thrills.
